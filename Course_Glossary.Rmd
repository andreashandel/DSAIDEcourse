There are lots of technical terms related to infectious disease epidemiology and modeling. I try to explain them whenever they show up first. However, I figured it might also be useful to have one central place for quick reference. Terms are ordered alphabetically. This is how I define them, others might have different definitions - and so might I in the future, I try to change/update my understanding of things every so often `r emo::ji('grin')`.

Note that in general, there is no regulatory terminology agency, so everyone can use these words to mean whatever they want. While some are fairly well defined, other terms are often used and abused in ways outside the definitions I provide. Always look carefully at what is described to decide what exactly is going on.

Not surprisingly, I'm not the 1st one with the idea of compiling a list of data science related terms and definitions. After starting this, I found another one by Frank Harrell, which you can find [here](http://hbiostat.org/doc/glossary.pdf). I'm sure I'll find and list more alternatives soon.

__Mechanistic Modeling:__ Building and using models that explicitly incorporate mechanisms and processes of the system under study to understand _how_ things interact and lead to specific outcomes. Many models in the hard sciences are of this type. A common way to formulate such models is with differential equations.


__Variable:__ Any quantity that we record like height, weight, income, or species type. In R, it is most common, that each variable is stored as a column in a data frame. The column name should be the name of the variable.
