# Overview

To showcase some of the work previous students have done, and as inspiration of future projects, below you can find links to a selection of past projects. 

<!-- (The reason not many projects for early years are shown is because I only post with student permission and I decided to post this in 2020 where it was hard to reach long-graduated students `r emo::ji('smile')`) -->
