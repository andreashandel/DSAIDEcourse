The main mode of communication will be through Slack. You should have gotten an email invite to the Slack workspace for this class.

If you are unfamiliar with Slack, it is essentially a chat/discussion tool. Within the workspace for this class, you will find different channels. That's Slack name for a discussion forum. The names and descriptions of the different channels should be self-explanatory. You can also use Slack to send one or more individuals direct messages. 
I will use Slack to post any course related announcements. Check regularly. They will all be in the announcement channel.

Use the Slack channels widely to ask questions, to answer others' questions, to notify me and others of things that are unclear/wrong, to post links to interesting resources, etc. I hope we can use Slack  to build a _community of learners_ where you help and support each other. So please don't always wait for me to answer questions or provide feedback! Engage with each other. I will regularly visit and read the discussions and participate, but I hope that I will end up as one participant of many, not the only person providing answers.

I prefer that you use the online discussion instead of email to ask questions. The reason is that if you have a question, it is likely that others have it too. By asking and answering online, everyone can see it. That said, there might be instances where the question only relates to you. In such cases, feel free to either send me a direct message on Slack or email me. 

We will also occasionally use Zoom for optional, synchronous online get-togethers and discussions. I will post the links for each Zoom meeting on Slack. Tentative dates for Zoom meetings are listed in the _Schedule_ document. Those are subject to change. If we need to move things around, I'll let you know on Slack.
