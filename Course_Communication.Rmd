The main mode of communication will be through discussion boards on Slack. Use them widely to ask questions, to answer others' questions, to notify me and others of things that are unclear/wrong, to post links to interesting resources, etc. I hope we can use the discussion boards to build a _community of learners_ where you help and support each other. So please don't always wait for me to answer questions or provide feedback! Engage with each other. I will regularly visit and read the discussions and participate, but I hope that I will end up as one participant of many, not the only person providing answers.

I will use Slack to post announcements. Check regularly. They will all be in the announcement channel.

I prefer that you use the online discussion instead of email to ask questions. The reason is that if you have a question, it is likely that others have it too. By asking and answering online, everyone can see it. That said, there might be instances where the question only relates to you. In such cases, feel free to email me directly. 

If you get stuck badly enough that asynchronous discussion or email doesn't help, or if there are other reasons you want to talk in real time, let me know and we can either set up a video conversation (skype or zoom) or you can come by my office if you are on campus. 

We will also use Github for some specific communications, detailed instructions on that will be provided.
