This page lists resources that are used or mentioned in this course. For a more extensive list of resources, see the _General Resources_ page.

All materials described below are (should be) freely available online. If you can't get to them, let me know. Note that a lot of the listed resources are dynamic and ever changing. That means occasionally links might not work, sites go offline, chapters in online books get re-arranged, etc. If you notice anything that's not quite right, please let me know.

# General help

* The main place to get any course specific help are the various Slack channels in our class workspace. Use them widely to ask questions, to answer others' questions, to post links to interesting resources, etc. 
* There will very likely be times when some material in the course doesn't quite make sense and you need to do some auxiliary reading. Google will be your best friend. Wikipedia is often a very good starting point for many topics. 



# Books

* [Infectious Disease Epidemiology - a Model-based Approach (IDEMAB)](https://andreashandel.github.io/IDEMAbook/). This is the book that goes with the class, it is basically an extended version of my previous lecture notes. 


# Online courses

Throughout this course, I link to videos from a few online courses that cover similar topics to this course. While the videos are embedded and you do not need to sign up for those online courses, if you are interested, you could. Signing up for those courses should be free.

* [Epidemics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/epidemics). This course was developed by several infectious disease faculty at Penn State and offered through the MOOC provider Coursera. 
* [Epidemics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/hkuepidemics/). This course has the same name and lives on the same platform as the Penn State course, but it is offered by a team of instructors from the University of Hong Kong (HKU).

Note that the HKU course started out as a course called "Epidemics" on the EdX platform. Now there is the above course on the Coursera platform. In addition, there is a sequence of courses, [Epidemics I-IV on the EdX platform](https://www.edx.org/search?q=epidemics). The Coursera and EdX offerings seem similar, I don't know if/how they differ.

Again, for this class, I will embed all relevant materials so you don't need to further check out those courses. However, if you are interested, I encourage you to give them a try, they have great content and cover some topics which we won't cover in this course. Neither of these courses takes an explicit model-based perspective, but many topics are discussed with such a framework in mind (and several of the instructors for each course are infectious disease modelers).




# Hands-on/interactive resources

* [Dynamical Systems Approach to Infectious Disease Epidemiology (DSAIDE)](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIDE/). The R package for the course which lets you do hands-on explorations of the different topics we will cover.


# Quiz sheets
