This page lists resources that are used or mentioned in this course. For a more extensive list of resources, see the _General Resources_ page.

All materials described below are (should be) freely available online. If you can't get to them, let me know. Note that a lot of the listed resources are dynamic and ever changing. That means occasionally links might not work, sites go offline, chapters in online books get re-arranged, etc. If you notice anything that's not quite right, please let me know.

# General help

* The main place to get any course specific help are the various Slack channels in our class workspace. Use them widely to ask questions, to answer others' questions, to post links to interesting resources, etc. 
* There will very likely be times when some material in the course doesn't quite make sense and you need to do some auxiliary reading. Google will be your best friend. Wikipedia is often a very good starting point for many topics. 



# Books

* [Introduction to Data Science (IDS)](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/) is the book I'll refer to a good bit in the 1st part of the course. 


# Hands-on/interactive resources

* [Online Tutorials (primers) by Rstudio (RP)](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) are a great source for introductory, interactive tutorials covering basics of R coding and data analysis. We'll use several of those primers in the class.
