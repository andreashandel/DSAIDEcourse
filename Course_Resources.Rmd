This page lists resources that are frequently used or mentioned in this course. For a more extensive list of resources related to the course topics, see the _General Resources_ page.

All materials described below are (should be) freely available online. If you can't get to them, let me know. Note that a lot of the listed resources are dynamic and ever changing. That means occasionally links might not work, sites go offline, chapters in online books get re-arranged, etc. If you notice anything that's not quite right, please let me know.

# General help

* The main place to get any course specific help are the online discussion boards. Use them widely to ask questions, to answer others' questions, to post links to interesting resources, etc. 
* Most questions you will have are likely not course specific, but will have to do with R/Github/RMarkdown/etc. For that, Google will be your best friend. Most of the time, someone had the same problem/question you do and someone else answered it. The only tricky thing is finding that post. Even after years of doing this, I probably google how to do something in R every day `r emo::ji('smiley')`.
* When you search online for help, quite often you land on some _StackExchange_ site. These are a collection of widely-used online question and answer sites covering all kinds of topics (including R, Github, Data Analysis, etc.). The majority of the time, you will find an answer, or at least something that gets you closer, on those sites.
* The [Rstudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/) is another good place to ask questions. It is not as widely used as StackExchange, but it seems to be more newcomer friendly. I haven't used it much.


# Books

* [Infectious Disease Epidemiology - A modern systems approach](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIDEbook/) is an online book I wrote which contains the majority of the class reading. 


# Hands-on/interactive resources

* [DSAIDE R package](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIDE/). We will use this package a lot in this course to get hands-on experience with infectious disease models and important infectious disease epidemiology concepts.
