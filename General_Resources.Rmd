The _Course Resources_ page was becoming too large, so I decided to split things into two pages. The _Course Resources_ page lists materials directly related to and used/mentioned in the course. This page lists a lot of other resources that are not used or mentioned explicitly in the course, but that might be useful and interesting.  For even more materials, see the links to various lists by others at the end of this document.

All materials described below are (should be) freely available online. For better or for worse, a lot of the resources I list below are dynamic and ever changing. That means occasionally links might not work, sites go offline, chapters in online books get re-arranged, etc. If any link does not work and you can't access the materials for some reason, let me know so I can update this document.

# Lists and other sources

* I created lists related to various topics, including ID Epi and modeling. You can find all lists [at this link on github](https://github.com/ahgroup/research-and-teaching-resource-lists).  (These lists are works in progress, and some are better/more useful than others. Feel free to send me links/resources to include).


_Obviously, there is no way the materials I list here are in any way complete. Let me know if you find other relevant and good sources._
